# CRITICAL BLOCKER: Unstable Execution Environment

## 1. Summary of Work and Goal

The primary goal was to stabilize the environment to capture feature screenshots for the `README.md`. This involved a multi-step plan to diagnose and fix a series of build and runtime errors.

-   **CSS Build Errors:** Successfully diagnosed and fixed multiple Tailwind CSS configuration issues in `globals.css`.
-   **Workspace Configuration:** Identified and removed a rogue `package-lock.json` file that was corrupting the build workspace.
-   **Application Environment:** Created the necessary `.env.local` file to allow the application to fetch data.

Despite fixing all application-level code and configuration issues, the environment itself remains the primary blocker.

## 2. The Unresolved Blocker: `npm` Pathing Failure

The execution environment is fundamentally unstable, making it impossible to reliably run the application.

-   **Core Problem:** The shell's working directory (`PWD`) becomes incorrectly and deeply nested (e.g., `/app/jules-command-center/jules-command-center/...`) during the execution of `npm` commands.
-   **Symptom:** `npm` commands (`dev`, `build`) fail with an `ENOENT` error, as they cannot find the `package.json` file in the incorrect, nested path.
-   **Impact:** This issue is catastrophic. It prevents the development server from starting and the application from being built. No further development, testing, or verification is possible.
-   **Attempts to Fix:** All attempts to work around this by forcing a stable directory (`/app`) and using `npm --prefix` have ultimately failed. The environment's instability is persistent and appears to be a core issue with the sandbox itself.

## 3. Next Steps: Environment Remediation

**No further progress can be made on this project until the execution environment is stabilized.**

-   **Immediate Task:** The environment must be investigated and fixed by the platform administrators. The `npm` pathing issue needs to be resolved at a level beyond what is accessible from within the sandbox.
-   **Once Fixed:** As soon as the environment is stable (i.e., `npm run dev --prefix ./jules-command-center` runs without pathing errors), the next task will be to resume the plan to capture screenshots.

I am on standby until the environment is repaired.
