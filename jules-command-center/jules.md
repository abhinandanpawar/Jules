# Jules Command Center: Project Blueprint

This document outlines the vision, current state, and future direction of the Jules Command Center. It is a living document that we can evolve together as we enhance this powerful tool.

## 1. The Motivation

Managing a sophisticated AI software engineer like me across multiple repositories presents a unique challenge. Standard project management tools are not designed for our asynchronous, GitHub-centric workflow. The core motivation behind the Jules Command Center was to create a **single, unified, and intelligent dashboard** for you to:

-   Visualize all tasks assigned to me, regardless of the repository.
-   Organize and prioritize my workload seamlessly.
-   Create new tasks for me without context switching.
-   Have a clear, real-time overview of my activities.

This tool is purpose-built to enhance our collaboration and make managing my work effortless and efficient.

## 2. What We've Accomplished (Version 2.0 - The AI-Powered Upgrade)

This version of the Jules Command Center integrates AI to transform it from a passive dashboard into an intelligent assistant. It includes all the features of Version 1.0, plus:

-   **AI-Powered Smart Prompting:** When creating a task, you can now click "Improve with AI". The system will send your draft description to the TinyLlama model, which rewrites it into a well-structured and detailed prompt, optimized for my understanding.
-   **AI-Driven Automated Status Updates:** The application now listens for your comments on pull requests via GitHub Webhooks. When you comment, the AI analyzes the intent. If it detects approval (e.g., "Looks good, merge it!"), it will automatically apply a `jules-status:approved` label to the task, which can then be used to move the card to the 'Done' column.

## 3. The Future Vision (Roadmap)

This is just the beginning. The Jules Command Center is a platform that we can build upon to create an even more powerful and automated system. Here are some of the exciting features we can work on next:

-   **Full Workflow Automation:** Implement GitHub Webhooks to automatically move task cards across the board based on my actions (e.g., when I create a branch, open a pull request, or when you merge my PR).
-   **Jules Analytics Dashboard:** Create a new view that provides insights into my performance, such as average task completion time, success rate per repository, and types of tasks I excel at.
-   **Cost & Token Tracking:** If I ever have an associated cost, we could integrate tracking to monitor the cost of each task.
-   **Direct Assignment:** Build a mechanism where dragging a card to the "Ready for Jules" column *directly* assigns me the task, eliminating the need to interact with me separately.
-   **Advanced Filtering & Search:** Add controls to filter tasks by labels, assignees, or keywords, and a powerful search bar to find any task instantly.

## 4. How to Collaborate on This Project

When you want me to work on improving the Jules Command Center, please create a new task for me using the board itself!

1.  Click the **"New Task"** button.
2.  Select the `jules-command-center` repository.
3.  Give the task a clear title (e.g., "Implement full workflow automation via webhooks").
4.  Add a detailed description of the feature or improvement you'd like.
5.  Once the task is created, you can drag it to the "Ready for Jules" column and let me know you're ready for me to start.

I am excited to continue working with you to make this the ultimate command center for our collaboration.
